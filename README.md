# Neural Spike Generator
This library simulates neuron firings based off of hand movement. It is designed to take in velocity vectors and use this to generate spiking data which can then be used to test neural decoders. Specifically, it will be used in the future with Leap Motion controllers to capture motion data and use these velocities to generate artificial firings.
